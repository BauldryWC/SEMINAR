Chapter 7- Preparing Data for Analysis

========================================================

7.1 Cleaning Data for Merging
- In order to successfully merge two or more data frames we need to make sure that they are in the same format.
- The names command will show variable names in a data frame.
- The head command shows the first few observations.
- The tail command shows the last few observations.
- The dim command will show you the number of observations and variables in a data frame.
- The summary command will give a basic description of statistics in a data frame.
- The table command creates a contingency table with counts of the number of observations per combination of factor variables. 
- You can convert objects into data frame type objects with the data.frame command.
- Long-formatted TSCS data: data frame where rows identify observations of a particular subject
- Some statistical data analyses assume that data is ordered in a specific way. 
- The subset command allows you to look at smaller parts of the data and examine outliers.
- !s denote "not".
- !is.na means "not missing".
- The factor command allows you to convert a variable into a factor variable with the labels you want.

7.2 Merging Data Sets
- When your data sets are in the same format and have variables with identically matching ID values you can merge your data sets together.
- The cbind command binds columns from the data sets together.
- cbind is not good for real world data.
- rbind binds rows together. 
- The safest and most effective way to merge two data sets together is with the merge command.
- You should set the argument to all=TRUE so that you keep all the observations from both data sets.
- The data.table package works well for large data sets.
- The duplicated command checks for duplicate values.

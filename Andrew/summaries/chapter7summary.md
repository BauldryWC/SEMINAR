## Chapter 7

* Chapter 7 begins talking about the importance and usefulness of merging data together

* Before starting it is key to become accquainted with the sets of data by using codes like dim() a and summary()

* There are some codes for reshaping and renaming data

* Theres ways to make subgroups/subsets of the data which can help omit outliers or data with NA

* You can change variable types such as character to numeric or numeric to character, but be wary for sometimes there is a specific reason it is that way

* Generally the safest and most effective way to merge two data sets is with the merge command, not bind or cbind

* Merge command and other commands don't work as well the bigger the data set becomes

* Overall these are all good ways to clean up data and make everything a little easier to understand

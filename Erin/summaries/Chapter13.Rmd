Erin Kreiling
========================================================

- LaTex is the standard markup language for academic documents.
- HTML is best for presenting research findings on the internet.

13.1 The Basics
- Markdown does not have as many capabilities as HTML.
- Unlike HTML, markdown documents do not have a preamble.
- # level one header
- ## level two header
- ### level three header
- Create a horizontal line with three or more equals signs.
- Paragraphs are created by simply hitting return in between lines of text.
- Italicize words by putting them between *asterisks*
- Make words bold by putting them between **double asterisks**
- Use LINK_TEXT to create hyperlinks.
- To create itemized lists just use dashes like bullet points.

13.2 Markdown with Pandoc and Custom CSS
- Markdown is simple so it lacks research tools like footnotes and bibliographies. 
- Pandoc will allow you insert footnotes and BibTeX bibliographies in your R Markdown documents.
- You can customize the appearance of your Markdown files with custom CSS style sheets. 

13.3 Slideshows with Markdown, knitr, and HTML
- You can use these three to create HTML5 slideshows.
- Advantages of HTML presentations using markdown: simple Markdown syntax, nice way to show content on the web, and any kind of content can be incorporated, like videos.
- HTML presentations are easier to make than slidify ones.
- A R presentation includes a .Rpres file, a .md file, and knitr cache and figure folders.

13.4 Publishing Markdown Documents
- You can open HTML files in any web browser. 
- Dropbox public folders are great for sharing webpages and files. 
- GitHub is another great option for publishing webpages.

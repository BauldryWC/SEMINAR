Chapter 11- Presenting with LaTeX
========================================================

11.1 The Basics
- RStudio is a fully functional LaTeX editor.
- R Sweave files are LaTeX files that can include knitr code chunks.
- Lyx is a Microsoft Word-type program that is easy for beginners to use.
- Arguments for LaTeX commands are enclosed in curly braces {}.
- Commands start with a backslash.
- You tell LaTeX where the body of your document starts by typing \begin{document} and where it ends by typing \end{document}.
- Use the command hyperref for clickable hyperlinks and the command natbib for bibliography formatting.
- Use the command section to create section-level headings.
- Paragraphs are created by adding a blank line between lines.
- hrulefill creates horizontal lines.
- You can make text bold by using textbf.
- Math syntax uses backslashes and parentheses.
- You can create lists using the \begin{itemize} command.

11.2 Bibliographies with BibTeX
- All major TeX distributions come with BibTeX.
- Bibliographies are stored in files with the extension .bib
- Each citation must have a unique CITE_KEY.
- You can use the \bibliography command to include citations from a BibTeX file.
- knitr's write_bib command currently does not have the ability to append package citations to an existing file, but instead writes them to a new file.

11.3 Presentations with LaTeX Beamer
- Combining LaTeX and knitr can make fully reproducible presentations that dynamically create and present results. 
- Beamer class documents create PDF files.
- You use documentclass to set a LaTeX document as a beamer slideshow.

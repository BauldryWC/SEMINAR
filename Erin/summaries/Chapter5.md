Chapter 5 Summary- Storing, Collaborating, Accessing Files, & Versioning
========================================================

- Storing data in a cloud is safer than on your computer or a flash drive because it is protected.
- Cloud storage allows access to documents from any computer or mobile device and can open up research to more collaborators. 
- Version control manages the different versions of a piece of work and monitors changes.
 
5.1 Saving Data in Reproducible Formats
- Using text file formats helps future proof your research.
- write.table saves data in plain-text formats from R.

5.2 Storing Your Files in the Cloud: Dropbox
- Dropbox creates a directory on your computer's hard drive in which files are stored, as well in the cloud-based server.
- Folders on Dropbox can be either Public or Non-Public.
- An SHA-1 hash is a long string of numbers and letters at the end of a line that serves as a unique ID, assigned by source_data.
- You cannot save files through a Dropbox URL link.
- Every time you save a document a new version is created on Dropbox.

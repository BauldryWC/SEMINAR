Reproducible Research\n  * Data and results can be recreated\n  * Helps find errors\n  * Should be easy to reproduce, if difficult it pretty much defeats the purpose of reproducible research.\n  * Keep track of data and all results.  \n  * It is important to document EVERYTHING you do\n    * This helps find errors and allows you to go back and make changes\n  * If we create reproducible data it allows others to critique and help\n  * verified by reproduction\n  * saves time for others\n  * By documenting everything you have a more orginized research project.\n  * Easier for people to collaborate\n  * Easier to make changes\n  * People will take your research more seriously\n\n2. Who is This Book for?\n  * Me\n  * You\n  * Private Researchers\n    * Allows others to collaborate on major projects\n  * Professors\n    * Creating lecutres that are reproducible helps students and teachers\n  \n3. Tools\n  * R\n    * Programming language\n  * knitr\n    * R package for combining research and presentation\n  * Markup Languages\n    * Formating\n  * RStudio\n    * Integrated Developer Environment\n  * Cloud Storage & Versioning\n    * Make information more availible\n\n4. Another Why?\n  * Why R?\n    * Cause it's awesome and opensource and constantly being updated\n  * Why Knitr?\n    * Works with R \n  * Why RStudio?\n    * Very easy interface\n\n5. Installation\n  * Lots of steps\n\n6. Book\n  * Covers tools and steps for creating reproducible research and combining it with appropriate presentation\n  * Read in order\n  * Can be reproduced\n\n\n## Chapter Two\n\n### What's It About?\n\n1. Stages of reproducing data\n  * Gathering data\n  * Analyzing data\n  * Presenting data\n  \n2. Theory\n  * Not really covered in the book\n  \n3. Tips\n  * Document EVERYTHING\n    * Even each R session\n  * Save as text files\n    * Allows everyone to read it on any interface\n  * Humans should be able to read it\n    * Obviously...\n  * Tie your files together\n    * Link data and presentations\n  \n\n## Chapter Five\n\n### What's it About?\n\n1. Storing Data\n  * Data must be readable\n  * Cloud storage\n    * Don't have to worry about losing data\n    * Easy access for other collaborators\n\n2. DropBox\n  * One of the cloud storage/version control things covered in this chapter\n  * Limited storage for free\n  * Only saves old versions for 30 days\n  * Very easy to use\n  * Can be accessed anywhere\n  * You can invite collaborators\n\n3. GitHub\n  * The other cloud storage/version control covered in this chapter\n  * A little harder to understand at first\n  * Saves old versions indefinitly\n  * Easy for others to collaborate and edit data\n    * Saves changes that others makes \n  * Easy to leave notes on edits and different versions\n  * Need repositories to create versions\n  * Versions can be copied to different repositories\n  * When edits are made they can be pushed and pulled from the GitHub Site to others computers\n  * GitHub is directly linked with RStudio\n  * There are many commands that can be used to ignore or tag or branch files within your GitHub\n  * RStudio projects link to GitHub version control\n",

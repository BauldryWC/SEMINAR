Chapter 5 Summary- Storing, Collaborating, Accessing Files, & Versioning
========================================================

- Storing data in a cloud is safer than on your computer or a flash drive because it is protected.
- Cloud storage allows access to documents from any computer or mobile device and can open up research to more collaborators. 
- Version control manages the different versions of a piece of work and monitors changes.
 
5.1 Saving Data in Reproducible Formats
- Using text file formats helps future proof your research.
- write.table saves data in plain-text formats from R.

5.2 Storing Your Files in the Cloud: Dropbox
- Dropbox creates a directory on your computer's hard drive in which files are stored, as well in the cloud-based server.
- Folders on Dropbox can be either Public or Non-Public.
- An SHA-1 hash is a long string of numbers and letters at the end of a line that serves as a unique ID, assigned by source_data.
- You cannot save files through a Dropbox URL link.
- Every time you save a document a new version is created on Dropbox.

5.3 Storing Your Files in the Cloud: GitHub
- GitHub is an interface and cloud hosting service built on top of the Git version control system. 
- Basically, GitHub has everything that Dropbox has and more, but is more complicated to use as a novice.
- GitHub stores previous versions indefinitely.
- .gitignore makes Git ignore particular files.
- Asterisks are wildcards that stand for any character.
- You can add files to a new repository at any time by "pushing" them.
- The GitHub interface allows anyone to look at text files with a browser file.
- Anyone with a GitHub account can suggest changes to a file in a public repository. 
- Public repositories can have unlimited collaborators. 
- Basic GitHub workflow: 1. add changes with git add, 2. commit the changes, 3. pull changes, resolve any merge conflicts, and commit changes, 4. push your changes to GitHub

5.4 RStudio & GitHub
- You can Git initialize new RStudio projects, Git initialize existing projects, and create RStudio projects from cloned repositories. 
- The Review Changes window allows you to commit changes.

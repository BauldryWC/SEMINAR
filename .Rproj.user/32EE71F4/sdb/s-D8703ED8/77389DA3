It offers\n          a reason why markets are not always efficient.\n          \n          \\noindent\n\\textit{\\textbf{\\color{drkgreen} Uncertainty Surrounding Valuation of Securities}.} \n          Even if markets are\n          efficient, the valuation of a firm's security is subject to much uncertainty\n          because investors have limited info avail to value that security. Furthermore,\n          future CFs are uncertain.\n\n  \n\\section*{SECURITIES REGULATION} \n\\noindent Although publicly traded firms are required to disclose financial info and statements, a firm's manager still possess info about its financial condition that is not necessarily avail to investors. This situation is referred to as \\textit{asymmetric information.}\n  \\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.5in,itemsep=-2pt, topsep=-2pt]\n    \\item \\textit{\\textbf{\\color{drkgreen}Required Disclosure}}. Many regulations attempt to \n            ensure that businesses disclose accurate financial information and to provide all \n            investors with equal access to disclosure of relevant information.\n        \\begin {itemize}[itemsep=-2pt, topsep=-2pt]\n          \\item The Securities Act of 1933 - Complete disclosure of relevant information.\n          \\item The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 - Disclosure requirements extended to \n              secondary market issues.\n        \\end{itemize}\n    \\item\\textit{\\textbf{\\color{drkgreen}Regulatory Response to Financial Reporting Scandal}}\n        . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act \n        was passed to require that firms provide more complete and accurate information, and \n        imposed restrictions to ensure proper auditing by auditors and proper oversight.\n  \\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS}\n\\noindent Financial institutions are needed to resolve the limitations caused by market imperfections. They accept funds from surplus units and channel the funds to deficit units. Without fin. inst, \\textit{the info and transaction costs would be excessive}.\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\subsection*{Role of Depository Institutions}\n\\noindent Depository institutions accept deposits from surplus units and provide credit to deficit units through loans and purchases of securities. The main functions of depository are:\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.5in, itemsep=-2pt, topsep=-2pt]\n\\item Offer deposit accts to accommodate the amt and liquidity desired by surplus units.\n\\item Repackage funds received from deposits to provide loans desired by deficit units.\n\\item Accept risk on loans provided.\n\\item Have more expertise than individual surplus units in evaluating the creditworthiness of deficit units.\n\\item Diversify loan among numerous deficit units and therefore can absorb defaulted loans better than individual surplus units could.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\paragraph{Commercial Banks} Commercial banks are the most dominant depository institution. They serve both the private and public sectors. Some receive more funds from deposits than they need to make loans, others need more funds to accommodate customer requests than the amt of funds that they receive from deposits.  The \\textbf{federal funds market} \\emph{facilitates the flow of funds bw depository institutions}. Commercial banks are subject to regulations that are intended to limit their exposure to the risk of failure. The Federal Reserve (\"the Fed\") serves as a regulator of banks.\n\n\\paragraph{Savings Institutions} Savings institutions, sometimes referred to as thrift institutions, include savings and loan associations (S\\&Ls) and savings banks. Savings institutions can be owned by shareholders, but most are mutual (depositor owned). Like commercial banks, savings institutions rely on federal funds market to lend their excess funds or to borrow funds on a short-term basis. Whereas commercial banks concentrate on commercial loans, savings institutions concentrate on residential mortgage loans.\n\n\\paragraph{Credit Unions} Credit unions differ from commercial banks and savings institutions in that they \\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\\arabic*)]\n            \\item are nonprofit and\n            \\item restrict their business to the credit union members, who share a common bond (such as common employer or union). \n        \\end{enumerate*}\n\n\\subsection*{Role of Nondepository Institutions}\n\\paragraph{Finance Companies} Most finance companies obtain funds by issuing securities and then lend the funds to individuals and small businesses. The functions of finance companies and depository institutions overlap, although each type concentrates on a particular segment of the financial markets.\\vspace*{-3pt}\n\\paragraph{Mutual Funds} Mutual funds sell shares to surplus units and use the funds to purchase a portfolio of securities. They are the dominant nondepository financial institution when measured in total assets.\n\\paragraph{Securities Firms} Some securities firms act as a \\textbf{broker}, executing securities transactions between two parties. The broker fee is reflected in the \\textbf{spread} between the \\textbf{bid quote} and the \\textbf{ask quote}. Additionally, securities firms place newly issued for corporations and government entities; this task involves the primary market.  When securities firms \\textbf{underwrite} new securities, they may sell them for a client at a guaranteed price or may simply sell the securities at the best price they can get for their client. Furthermore, securities firms often act as \\textbf{dealers}, making a market in specific securities by maintaining an inventory of securities. They can also offer services on mergers and other forms of corporate restructuring.\n\\paragraph{Insurance Companies} Insurance companies provide individuals and firms with insurance policies that reduce the financial burden associated with death, illness, and damage to property.\n\\paragraph{Pension Funds} Pension funds provide an efficient way for individuals to save for their retirement. The pension funds manage the money until the individuals withdraw the funds from their accounts.  The money that is contributed to the funds are usually invested in stocks or bonds. Thus pension funds are important financial intermediaries that finance the needs of deficit units.\n\\subsection*{Comparision of Roles among Financial Institutions}\n\\noindent The role of financial institutions in facilitating the flow of funds from individual surplus units (investors) to deficit units is illustrated in the following diagram.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\centering\n\\tikzstyle{block} = [draw, rectangle, fill=blue!50, text width=10em, text centered, minimum height=15mm, node distance=5em]\n\\tikzstyle{block1} = [draw, rectangle, fill=ForestGreen, text width=8em, text centered, minimum height=15mm, node distance=7em]\n\\tikzstyle{block2} = [draw, rectangle, fill=Fuchsia, text width=10em, text centered,minimum height=25mm, node distance=5em]\n\\resizebox{14cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n\\node [block] (MF) {\\color{white}\\textbf{Mutual Funds}};\n\\node [block, above of=MF, yshift=1em] (FC) {\\color{white}\\textbf{Finance Companies}};\n\\node [block1, left of=FC, xshift=-10em] (SU) {\\color{white}\\textbf{Surplus Units}};\n\\node [block, above of=FC, yshift=1em] (DI) {\\color{white}\\textbf{Depository Institutions (Commercial Banks, Savings Institutions, Credit Unions)}};\n\\node [block, below of=MF, yshift=-1em](Ins){\\color{white}\\textbf{Insurance Companies}};\n\\node [block1, left of=Ins, xshift=-10em] (Holders) {\\color{white}\\textbf{Policyholders}};\n\\node [block, below of=Ins, yshift=-1em](PF){\\color{white}\\textbf{Pension Funds}};\n\\node [block1, left of=PF, xshift=-10em] (EE) {\\color{white}\\textbf{Employers and Employees}};\n\\node [block2, right of=MF, xshift=10em] (DU) {\\color{white}\\textbf{Deficit Units (Firms.

Thus, institutional investors not only provide financial support to companies but also exercise some degree of control over them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\chapter{$\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad$DETERMINATION OF INT. RATES}\\vspace*{-1.25cm}\n\\section*{LOANABLE FUNDS THEORY}\n\\noindent The \\textbf{loanable funds theory} suggests that the market interest rate is determined by factors controlling they supply of and demand for loanable funds. The phrase ``demand for loanable funds\" is widely used in financial markets to refer to the borrowing activities of households, businesses, and governments. \n\n\\noindent Interest rate movements have: \n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.5in, itemsep=-1pt, topsep=-1pt]\n\\item a direct influence on the cost of bank loans and credit for businesses and consumers (and thus, an impact on the profitability and value of financial institutions)\n\\item a direct influence on the rate of return for interest bearing investments and the cost of funds for financial institutions \n\\item a direct influence on the market value of debt securities such as money market securities, bonds, and mortgages\n\\item an indirect influence on equity security values (i.e., stocks)\n\\end{itemize}\nThus, financial institutions, businesses, consumers and investors are all interested in the level of, and changes in, rates of interest in the financial marketplace.\n\n\\subsection*{Household Demand for Loanable Funds} \n\\noindent Households demand loanable funds to finance housing expenditures, automobiles, and other household items, which results in installment debt. As the aggregate level of household income rises, so does installment debt.\n\nThere is an \\emph{inverse relationship} between the interest rate and the quantity of loanable funds demanded regarding household demand. This means they are willing to borrow more money at lower rates of interest.\n\\subsection*{Business Demand for Loanable Funds}\\noindent\nBusiness demand funds to invest in long-term (fixed) and short-term assets. The quantity of funds depends on the number of business projects to be implemented. Businesses evaluate a project by comparing the present value of its cash flows to its initial investment, as follows:\n\\[\\text{NPV}=-\\text{INV}+\\sum_{t=1}^n \\frac{\\text{CF}_t}{(1+r)^t}.\\]\nThe required return to implement a given project will be \\textit{lower if interest rates are lower} because of the cost of borrowing funds will be lower. This implies that businesses will demand a greater quantity of loanable funds when int rates are lower.\n\\paragraph{Shifts in the Demand for Loanable Funds} The business demand-for-loanable-funds schedule can change in reaction to any events that affect business borrowing preferences.  If economic conditions become more favorable, additional project will be acceptable as a result. The increase in demand will result in an outward shift (to the right) in the demand curve.\n\\subsection*{Government Demand for Loanable Funds}\nThe federal government's expenditure and tax policies are generally thought to be independent of interest rates. Thus, the govt's demand for funds is referred to as \\textbf{interest-inelastic}, or insensitive to interest rates. In contrast, municipal govts sometimes postpone expenditures if the cost of financing is \ntoo high, implying that their demand is somewhat sensitive to interest rates.\n\\subsection*{Foreign Demand for Loanable Funds}\nA foreign country's demand for U.S. funds is influenced by, among other factors, the \\emph{difference between its own interest rates and U.S. rates}. Thus, a larger quantity of U.S. funds will be demanded by foreign govts and corporations if their domestic interest rates are high relative to U.S. rates. As a result, the quantity of U.S. loanable funds demanded by foreign govts or firms will be \\emph{inversely related} to U.S. interest rates.\n\\subsection*{\\color{Mulberry} Aggregate Demand for Loanable Funds}\nThe aggregate demand for loanable funds is the sum of the quantities demanded by the separate sectors at any given interest rate. Because most sectors are likely to demand a larger quantity of funds at lower interest rates, it follows that the aggregate demand for loanable funds is \\emph{inversely related} to the prevailing interest rate. If the demand schedule for any sector changes, the aggregate demand schedule will also be affected.\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\centering\n\\tikzstyle{block} = [draw, rectangle, fill=blue!50, text width=10em, text centered, minimum height=15mm, node distance=5em]\n\\tikzstyle{block1} = [draw, rectangle, fill=ForestGreen, text width=8em, text centered, minimum height=15mm, node distance=7em]\n\\tikzstyle{block2} = [draw, rectangle, fill=Fuchsia, text width=10em, text centered,minimum height=25mm, node distance=5em]\n\\resizebox{11cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n    \\draw  (0,0) rectangle (2.5,3) (2.75,0) rectangle (5.25,3) (5.5,0) rectangle (8,3) \n            (8.25,0) rectangle (10.75,3)(11,0) rectangle (13.5,3);\n            \n     \\draw [fill=orange,orange] (0,-.25)--(13.5,-.25)--(6.75,-1)--(0,-.25) ;\n     \\draw (4,-2.25) rectangle (9.5,-6.5);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](4,-6.5)--(4,-2.25);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](4,-6.5)--(9.5,-6.5);\n     \\node [above] at (6.75,-2.25){\\textsf{Aggregate Demand}};\n     \\node [below] at (6.75,-6.5){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above,rotate=90] at (4,-4.375){\\textsf{\\textbf{Interest Rate}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (6,-2.5)--(8.5,-5);\n      \\node [below] at ((8.5,-5){$D_A$}; \n      \n    \\draw [ultra thick, gray] (.5,2.5)--(2,1);\n    \\node [below] at (2,1){$D_h$}; \n    \\node [above] at (1.25,3.35){\\textsf{Household}};\n    \\node [above] at (1.25,3){\\textsf{Demand}};\n    \n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (3.25,2.5)--(5,.75);\n    \\node [below] at (5,.75){$D_b$};\n    \\node [above] at (4,3.35){\\textsf{Business}};\n    \\node [above] at (4,3){\\textsf{Demand}};\n    \n    \\draw [ultra thick, drkgreen] (6.75,2.5)--(6.75,.75);\n    \\node [below] at (6.75,.75){$D_g$};\n    \\node [above] at (6.75,3.7){\\textsf{Federal}};\n    \\node [above] at (6.75,3.35){\\textsf{Government}};\n    \\node [above] at (6.75,3){\\textsf{Demand}};\n    \n    \\draw [ultra thick, RoyalPurple] (9,2.5)--(9.5,.75);\n    \\node [below] at (9.5,.75){$D_m$};\n    \\node [above] at (9.5,3.7){\\textsf{Municipal}};\n    \\node [above] at (9.5,3.35){\\textsf{Government}};\n    \\node [above] at (9.5,3){\\textsf{Demand}};\n    \n     \\draw [ultra thick, green] (11.5,2.5)--(13,.75);\n    \\node [below] at (13,.75){$D_f$};\n    \\node [above] at (12.25,3.35){\\textsf{Foreign}};\n    \\node [above] at (12.25,3){\\textsf{Demand}};\n    \n   \n\\end{tikzpicture}}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\caption{Determination of the Aggregate Demand Curve for Loanable Funds}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection*{Supply of Loanable Funds}\n\\begin{flushleft} The term ``supply of loanable funds\" refers to funds provided to financial markets by savers.

Yet households are a \\textbf{net suppliers}, whereas govts and businesses are \\textbf{net demanders} of loanable funds.\\end{flushleft}\\vspace*{-6pt}\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\\linewidth}\\sffamily\\small\n\\resizebox{5cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n     \\draw (0,0) rectangle (5,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(0,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(5,0);\n     \\node [below] at (2.5,0){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above,rotate=90] at (0,2){\\textsf{\\textbf{Interest Rate}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (2.5,.5) [out=45, in=-105] to  (4,3);\n      \\node [above] at (4,3){$S_A$};   \n\\end{tikzpicture}}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\caption{Aggregate Supply for Loanable Funds}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\nSuppliers are willing to suppy more funds \\emph{if the interest rate is higher}.  This means that the supply-of-loanable-funds schedule (also called the \\emph{supply curve}) is upward sloping. A supply of loanable funds exists at even a very low interest rate because some households choose to postpone consumption until later years, even when the reward for saving is low.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Effects of the Fed} The supply of funds in the US is also influenced by the monetary policy implemented by the Fed.\n\\paragraph{Aggregate Supply of Funds} The quantity of loanable funds demanded is normally expected to be more elastic, meaning more sensitive to interest rates, than the quantity of loanable funds supplied.  Thus the aggregate supply curve would have a steep slope, that is, it is interest-inelastic.\n\nEven though financial institutions play a critical intermediary role in channeling funds, they are not the ultimate suppliers of funds. Any change in a financial institution's supply of funds results only from a change in habits of the households, businesses, or govts that supply those funds.\n\n\\subsection*{Equilibrium Interest Rate}\nThe \\textbf{equilibrium interest rate} is the rate that \\emph{equates the aggregate demand for funds with the aggregate supply of loanable funds}. \n\\[\\boxed{D_A=D_h+D_b+D_g+D_m+D_f}\\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\boxed{S_A=S_h+S_b+S_g+S_m+S_f.}\\]\nIn equilibrium. $D_A=S_A$. If the demand increases without a corresponding increase in supply, there will be a shortage of loanable funds. Then, the interest rates will rise until an additional supply is available to accommodate the excess demand. Conversely,  an increase in supply without a corresponding increase in demand will result in a surplus of loanable funds. In this case, interest rates will fall until the quantity of funds supplied no longer exceeds the funds demanded.\n\nIn summary, when $D_A>S_A \\Longrightarrow \\text{interest rate rises,}\\quad D_A<S_A \\Longrightarrow \\text{ interest rate falls.}$\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\\begin {center}\n\\resizebox{5cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n     \\draw (0,0) rectangle (5,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(0,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(5,0);\n     \\node [below] at (2.5,0){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above,rotate=90] at (-.5,2){\\textsf{\\textbf{Interest Rate}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (2.5,.5) [out=45, in=-105] to  (4,3);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (1.5,2.75) --  (4,.5);\n     \\node [below right] at ((4,.5){$D_A$}; \n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (0,1.25) --  (3,1.25);\n     \\node [left] at (0,1.25){$i_e$};\n      \\node [above] at (4,3){$S_A$};   \n\\end{tikzpicture}}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\caption{Interest Rate Equilibrium}\n\\end{center}\\end{figure}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\section*{FACTORS THAT AFFECT INTEREST RATES}\nIn general, economic conditions are the primary forces behind a change in the the supply of savings or a change in the demand for funds. The saving behavior of the households that supply funds in the US is partially influenced by US fiscal policy, which determines the taxes paid by US households and thus determines the level of disposable income. The Fed's monetary policy also affects the supply of funds in the US because it determines the US money supply. The supply of funds provided by foreign investors is influenced by foreign economic conditions, including foreign interest rates.\n\nThe demand for funds in the US is indirectly affected by US monetary and fiscal policy because these policies influence economic growth and inflation, which in turn affect business demand for funds. Fiscal policy determines the budget deficit and therefore determines the federal govt demand for funds.\n\\paragraph{Impact of Economic Growth} Changes in economic conditions cause a shift in the demand curve for loanable funds which affects the equilibrium interest rate.\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[\\color{orange}Positive growth]\\textsf{ When businesses anticipate that economic conditions will improve, they revise upward the cash flows expected for various projects under consideration. Consequently, businesses identify more projects that are worth pursuing, and they are willing to borrow more funds. Their willingness to borrow more funds at any given interest rate reflects an outward shift in the demand curve.}\n\n\\textsf{ The supply schedule may also change in response to economic growth, but it is difficult to know which direction it will shift and the shift, if occurred, will likely be of smaller magnitude than the shift in the demand schedule. Overall, the expected impact of the increased expansion by businesses is an outward shift in the demand curve but no obvious change in the supply schedule, which causes an increase in the equilibrium interest rate.}\n\\item[\\color{orange}Negative growth] \\textsf{ A slowdown in the economy wil cause the demand curve to shift inward, reflecting less demand for loanable funds at any given interest rate. The supply curve may shift a little, but the direction of its shift is uncertain.  At the same time, the gradual reduction in labor income that occurs during a slowdown could reduce households' ability to save. Therefore, any shift in supply that does occur will likely be minor relative to the shift in the demand curve. The equilibrium interest rate is thus expected to decrease.}\n\\end{description} \\vspace*{-12pt}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\\begin {center}\n\\resizebox{10cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n     \\draw (0,0) rectangle (5,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(0,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(5,0);\n     \\draw [->, black](1,1.25)--(1,1.80);\n     \\draw [->, black](2.5,1.9)--(2.85,2.35);\n     \\node [below] at (2.5,0){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above] at (2.5,4.25){\\textsf{Impact of Increased Expansion by Firms}};\n     \\node [above,rotate=90] at (-.5,2){\\textsf{\\textbf{Interest Rate}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (2.5,.5) [out=45, in=-105] to  (4,3);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (1.5,2.75) --  (4,.5);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, drkgreen] (2,3.25) --  (4.5,1);\n     \n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (0,1.25) --  (3,1.25);\n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (0,1.85) --  (3.5,1.85);\n     \\node [left] at (0,1.25){$i_e$};\n     \\node [left] at (0,1.85){$i_2$};\n     \\node [below] at (4.5,1){$D_{A2}$};\n     \\node [below right] at (4,.5){$D_A$}; \n      \\node [above] at (4,3){$S_A$};   \n      \n      \n      \n      \\draw (7,0) rectangle (12,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](7,0)--(7,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](7,0)--(12,0);\n     \\draw [<-, black](8,1.3)--(8,1.85);\n     \\draw [<-, black](9.5,1.9)--(9.85,2.35);\n     \\node [below] at (9.5,0){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above] at (9.5,4.25){\\textsf{Impact of an Economic Slowdown}};\n     \\node [above,rotate=90] at (6.5,2){\\textsf{\\textbf{Interest Rate}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (9.5,.5) [out=45, in=-105] to  (11,3);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, drkgreen] (8.5,2.75) --  (11,.5);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (9,3.25) --  (11.5,1);\n     \n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (7,1.25) --  (10,1.25);\n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (7,1.85) --  (10.5,1.85);\n     \\node [left] at (7,1.25){$i_2$};\n     \\node [left] at (7,1.85){$i_e$};\n     \\node [below] at (11.5,1){$D_{A}$};\n     \\node [below right] at (11,.5){$D_{A2}$}; \n     \n      \\node [above] at (11,3){$S_A$};   \n\\end{tikzpicture}}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\caption{\\small\\sffamily{Impacts of Economic Growth on Interest Rates}}\\vspace*{-20pt}\n\\end{center}\\end{figure}\n\\paragraph{Impact of Inflation} Changes in inflationary expectations can affect interest rates by affecting the amount of spending by households or businesses. Decisions to spend affect the amt saved (supply of funds) and the amt borrowed (demand for funds).\n\n\\textbf{\\color{BrickRed} Fisher Effect} Fisher's theory of interest does not contradict the loanable funds theory but simply offers an additional explanation for interest rate movements.  Fisher proposed that nominal interest pmts compensate savers in two ways: \n\\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\\arabic*)]\n\\item \\emph{They compensate for a saver's reduced purchasing power}, and \\item \\emph{they provide an additional premium to savers for forgoing present consumption}. \\end{enumerate*} Savers are willing to forgo consumption only if they receive a premium on their savings above the anticipated rate of inflation, that is\n\\[\\boxed{i=E(\\text{INF})+i_R} \\quad \\text{equivalently}\\quad i_R=i-E(\\text{INF}).\\]\nWhen inflation rate is higher than anticipated, the real int rate is relatively low. Borrowers benefit since they were able to borrow at a lower nominal int rate than would have been offered if inflation had been accurately forecasted. When the inflation rate is lower than anticipated, the real int rate is relatively high and borrowers are adversely affected.\n\\paragraph{Impact of Monetary Policy} When the Fed increases the money supply, it increases the supply of loanable funds and this places downward pressure on interest rates. If the Fed reduces the money supply, it reduces the supply of loanable funds. Assuming no change in demand, this action place upward pressure on interest rates.\n\n\n\n\\emph{When holding other factors constant, higher budget deficit place upward pressure on interest rates.}\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\\sffamily\\small\n\\centering\n\\tikzstyle{block} = [draw, rectangle, fill=blue!50, text width=10em, text centered, minimum height=5mm, node distance=3em]\n\\tikzstyle{block1} = [draw, rectangle, fill=ForestGreen, text width=10em, text centered, minimum height=5mm, node distance=3em]\n\\tikzstyle{block2} = [draw,rectangle, fill=white, white, text width=5em, text centered,minimum height=5mm, node distance=5em]\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[x=5,y=5]\n\\node [block] (Fed) {\\color{white}\\textbf{Federal Government}};\n\n\\node [block2, below left of=MF, xshift=-7em, yshift=-1em](taxes){\\color{black}\\textsf{\\small{Taxes}}};\n\\node [block2, below left of=MF, yshift=-1em](Sec){\\color{black}\\textsf{\\small{Security Purchases}}};\n\\node [block2, below right of=MF, yshift=-1em](Treasury){\\color{black}\\textsf{\\small{Treasury Securities}}};\n\\node [block2, below right of=MF, xshift=7em, yshift=-1em](Exp){\\color{black}\\textsf{\\small{Government Expenditures}}};\n\\node [block1, below of =MF, yshift=-7em](private){\\color{white}\\textbf{Private Sector}};\n\n\n%arrows\n\\path [line] (taxes) |-node[yshift=0.755em, xshift=1em] {\\color{black}\\$}(Fed);\n\\path [line] (private) -|node[yshift=0.755em, xshift=1em] {\\color{black}\\$}(taxes);\n\\path [line] (Fed) -|node[yshift=0.755em, xshift=-1em] {\\color{black}\\$}(Exp);\n\\path [line] (Exp) |-node[yshift=0.755em, xshift=-1em] {\\color{black}\\$}(private);\n\n\\draw [line] (-3.5em,-9em) --node[yshift=0em, xshift=-1em] {\\color{black}\\$}(Sec);\n\\draw [line] (Sec) --node[yshift=0em, xshift=-1em] {\\color{black}\\$}(-3.5em,-.5em);\n\\draw [line] (3.5em,-.75em) -- (Treasury);\n\\draw [line] (Treasury) --(3.5em,-9em);\n\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\caption{Flow of Funds between the Fed Govt and the Private Sector}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\\paragraph{Impact of Budget Deficit}\nThe US govt is a major participant in the demand for loanable funds. A higher federal govt deficit increases the quantity of loanble funds demanded at any prevailing interest rate, which causes an outward shift in the demand curve, thus interest rate will rise. Excessive govt demand for these funds tends to ``crowd out\" the private demand for funds. The fed govt may be willing to pay whatever is necessary to borrow these funds, but the private sector may not. This impact is known as the \\textbf{crowding-out effect}.\n\\paragraph{Impact of Foreign Flows of Funds} The interest rate for a specific currency is determined by \\emph{the demand for funds denominated in that currency and the supply of funds available in that currency}. In general, the shifts are driven by large institutional investors seeking a high return on their investments. These investors commonly attempt to invest funds in debt securities in countries where interest rates are high. However, many countries that have relatively high interest rates also tend to have high inflation, which can weaken their local currencies.  Thus, investors tend to avoid investing in countries with high interest rates if the threat of inflation is very high.\n\n\n%chpter 3\n\\chapter{$\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad$STRUCTURES OF INTEREST RATES}\\vspace*{-.5in}\n\\section*{WHY DEBT SECURITY YIELDS VARY}\n\\noindent\nThe yields on debt securities are affected by the following characteristics:\n  \\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-2pt,topsep=-2pt,leftmargin=.5in]\n    \\item Credit (default) risk\n    \\item Liquidity\n    \\item Tax status\n    \\item Term to maturity\n  \\end{itemize}\n\\subsection*{Credit (Default) Risk}\n\\noindent\nIf all other characteristics are equal, securities with a higher degree of default risk must offer higher yields before investors will purchase them.\n\\paragraph{Rating Agencies} Rating agencies charge the issuers of debt securities a fee for assessing the default risk of those securities. The most popular rating agencies are Moody's Investors Service and Standard \\& Poor's. \n\\begin{figure}[h]\\sffamily\\small\n\n\\centering\n\\rowcolors{2}{yellow!10}{gray!10}\n\\resizebox{11cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{lcc}\n\\cellcolor{Turquoise}\\textbf{\\color{white} DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY}& \\cellcolor{Turquoise}\\textbf{\\color{white} MOODY'S} & \\cellcolor{Turquoise}\\textbf{\\color{white} STANDARD \\& POOR'S}\\\\\n\\textsf{Highest quality}&\\textsf{Aaa}&\\textsf{AAA}\\\\\n\\textsf{High quality}&\\textsf{Aa}&\\textsf{AA}\\\\\n\\textsf{High-medium quality}&\\textsf{A}&\\textsf{A}\\\\\n\\textsf{\\color{red}Medium quality}&\\textsf{\\color{red}\\textbf{Baa}}&\\color{red}\\textsf{\\textbf{BBB}}\\\\\n\\textsf{Medium-low quality}&\\textsf{Ba}&\\textsf{BB}\\\\\n\\textsf{Low quality (speculative)}&\\textsf{B}&\\textsf{B}\\\\\n\\textsf{Poor quality}&\\textsf{Caa}&\\textsf{CCC}\\\\\n\\textsf{Very poor quality}&\\textsf{Ca}&\\textsf{CC}\\\\\n\\textsf{Lowest quality (in default)}&\\textsf{C}&\\textsf{DDD,D}\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{\\small {Rating Classification by Rating Agencies}}\\vspace*{-6pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\\paragraph{Accuracy of Credit Ratings} The ratings issued by the agencies are opinions, not guarantees. Bonds that are assigned a low credit rating experience default more frequently than bonds assigned a higher rating, which suggests that the rating can be a useful indicator of risk. However, credit rating agencies do not always detect firm's financial problems.\n\\paragraph{Oversight of Credit Rating Agencies} The Financial Reform Act of 2010 established an Office of Credit Ratings within the SEC to regulate credit rating agencies. The act mandates that credit rating agencies must disclose their rating over time, and that they are to be held accountable if their ratings prove to be inaccurate. The act also allows investors to sue an agency for issuing credit ratings that the agency should have known were inaccurate.\n\n\\subsection*{Liquidity}\\noindent\nInvestors prefer securities that are \\textbf{liquid}, meaning that they could be easily converted to cash without a loss in value. Thus, if all else are equal, securities with less liquidity will have to offer a higher yield to attract investors. Securities with short-term maturity or an active secondary market have greater liquidity.\n\\subsection*{Tax Status}\\noindent\nIf all other characteristics are similar, taxable securities must offer a higher before-tax yield than tax-exempt securities. When assessing the expected yield of various securities with similar risk and maturity, it is common to convert them into an after-tax form, as follows:\n\\[Y_{at}=Y_{bt}(1-T).\\]\nState taxes should be considered along with federal taxes in determining the after-tax yield. Treasury securities are exempt from state income tax, and municipal securities are sometimes exempt as well.\n\\subsection*{Term to Maturity}\\noindent\nMaturity differs among debt securities and is another reason that debt security yields differ. The \\textbf{term structure of interest rates} defines the relationship between the term to maturity and the annualized yield of debt securities at a specific moment in time while holding other factors, such as risk, constant.\n\\section*{ESTIMATING THE APPROPRIATE YIELD}\nThe appropriate yield to be offered on a debt security is based on the risk-free rate for the corresponding maturity, with adjustments to capture various characteristics. \n\n\\[\\boxed{Y_n=R_{f,n}+DP+LP+TA.}\\]\nwhere\n\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{rcl}\n$Y_n$&$=$&yield of an $n$-day debt security\\\\\n$R_{f,n}$&$=$&yield of an $n$-day Treasury (risk-free)security\\\\\n$DP$&$=$&default premium to compensate for credit risk\\\\\n$LP$&$=$&liquidity premium to compensate for less liquidity\\\\\n$TA$&$=$&adjustment due to the difference in tax status\n\\end{tabular}\\end{center}\n\n\\section*{A CLOSER LOOK AT THE TERM STRUCTURE}\n\\subsection*{Pure Expectations Theory}\\noindent\nAccording to \\textbf{pure expectations theory}, the term structure of interest rates (as reflected in the shape of the yield curve) is determined solely by expectations of interest rates.\n\\paragraph{Impact of an Expected Increase in Interest Rates} Assume that the annualize yields of short-term and long-term risk-free securities are similar; that is, suppsose the yield curve is flat. Then assume that investors begin to believe that interest rates will \\textit{rise}.  Investors will respond by investing their funds mostly in the short term so that they can soon reinvest their funds at higher yields after int rates increase. When investors flood the short-term market and avoid the long-term, they may cause the yiled curve to adjust. The large supply of funds in the short-term markets will force annualized yields down. Meanwhile, the reduced supply of long-term funds forces the long-term yields up.\n\nAssuming that the borrowers who plan to issue securities also expect int rates to increase, they prefer to lock in the present int rate over a long period of time. Thus, borrowers will prefer to issue long-term securities rather than short-term securities. This results in a relatively small demand for short-term funds. Consequently, there is downward pressure on the yield of short-term funds.  There is a corresponding incr. in the demand for long-term funds by borrowers, which places an upward pressure on long-term funds. Overall, the expectation of higher int rates changes the demand and supply for funds in diff maturity mrkts, which forces the original flat yield curve ($YC_1$) to pivot upward (counterclockwise) and become upward sloping.\n\\begin{figure}[h]\\begin {center}\n\\resizebox{14cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n     \\draw (0,0) rectangle (5,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(0,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(5,0);\n     \\draw [<-, black](1,1.35)--(1,2.1);\n    \n     \\node [below] at (2.5,-.35){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above] at (2.5,4.65){\\textsf{\\textbf{Market for 3-Month (Short-Term)}}};\n     \\node [above] at (2.5,4.25){\\textsf{\\textbf{Risk-Free Debt}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (.75,1) [out=10, in=-115] to  (3.5,3.5);\n      \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (1,.5) [out=10, in=-115] to  (4,3);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (.75,2.75) --  (4,.5);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (1,3.25) --  (4.25,1);\n     \n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (0,1.3) --  (2.75,1.3);\n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (0,2.1) --  (2.5,2.1);\n     \\node [left] at (0,1.25){$i_2$};\n     \\node [left] at (0,2.1){$i_1$};\n     \\node [below] at (4.5,1){$D_{1}$};\n     \\node [below right] at (4,.5){$D_2$}; \n      \\node [above] at (4,3){$S_2$};   \n       \\node [above] at (3.5,3.5){$S_1$};  \n     \n     \n        \\draw (6,0) rectangle (11,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](6,0)--(6,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](6,0)--(11,0);\n     \\draw [->, black](7,1.7)--(7,2.45);\n    \n     \\node [below] at (8.5,-.35){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above] at (8.5,4.65){\\textsf{\\textbf{Market for 3-Month (Short-Term)}}};\n     \\node [above] at (8.5,4.25){\\textsf{\\textbf{Risk-Free Debt}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (6.75,1) [out=10, in=-115] to  (9.5,3.5);\n      \\draw [ultra thick, red] (7,.5) [out=10, in=-115] to  (10,3);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (7.25,3.75) --  (10.5,1.5);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (7,3.25) --  (10.25,1);\n     \n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (6,1.70) --  (9,1.70);\n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (6,2.5) --  (8.75,2.5);\n     \\node [left] at (6,1.7){$i_1$};\n     \\node [left] at (6,2.5){$i_2$};\n     \\node [below] at (10.5,1){$D_{1}$};\n     \\node [below right] at (10.5,1.5){$D_2$}; \n      \\node [above] at (10,3){$S_1$};   \n       \\node [above] at (9.5,3.5){$S_2$}; \n      \n      \n       \\draw (12,0) rectangle (17,4);\n       \\draw(13,0)--(13,.25) (16.5,0)--(16.5,.25);\n       \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (12,2) --  (16,2);\n       \\node [right] at (16,2){$YC_1$};\n       \\draw [ultra thick, drkgreen](12.25,1.5)[out=30,in=-170] to (16.5,2.5);\n       \\node [above] at (16.5,2.5){$YC_2$};\n       \\node [above,rotate=90] at (11.75,2){\\textsf{\\textbf{Yield}}};\n       \\node [above] at (14.5,4.65){\\textsf{\\textbf{Yield Curve}}};\n       \\node [below] at (13,0) {\\textsf{\\small{3 Months}}};\n        \\node [below] at (16.5,0) {\\textsf{\\small{10 Years}}};\n         \\node [below] at (14.5,-.5){\\textsf{\\textbf{Term to Maturity}}};\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\caption{Impact of a Sudden Expectation of Higher Interest Rates}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\end{center}\\end{figure}\n\\paragraph{Impact of an Expected Decline in Interest Rates} If investors expect int rates to decr in the future, they will prefer to invest in long-term funds rather than short-term funds because they could lock in today's int rate before interest rates fall.

Overall, the expectation of lower int rates causes the shape of the yield curve to pivot downward (clockwise).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\\begin {center}\n\\resizebox{14cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n     \\draw (0,0) rectangle (5,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(0,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](0,0)--(5,0);\n     \\draw [->, black](1,1.35)--(1,2.1);\n    \n     \\node [below] at (2.5,-.35){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above] at (2.5,4.65){\\textsf{\\textbf{Market for 3-Month (Short-Term)}}};\n     \\node [above] at (2.5,4.25){\\textsf{\\textbf{Risk-Free Debt}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (.75,1) [out=10, in=-115] to  (3.5,3.5);\n      \\draw [ultra thick, red] (1,.5) [out=10, in=-115] to  (4,3);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (.75,2.75) --  (4,.5);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (1,3.25) --  (4.25,1);\n     \n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (0,1.3) --  (2.75,1.3);\n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (0,2.1) --  (2.5,2.1);\n     \\node [left] at (0,1.25){$i_1$};\n     \\node [left] at (0,2.1){$i_2$};\n     \\node [below] at (4.5,1){$D_{2}$};\n     \\node [below right] at (4,.5){$D_1$}; \n      \\node [above] at (4,3){$S_1$};   \n       \\node [above] at (3.5,3.5){$S_2$};  \n     \n     \n    \\draw (6,0) rectangle (11,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](6,0)--(6,4);\n     \\draw [->, black, thick](6,0)--(11,0);\n     \\draw [<-, black](7,1.7)--(7,2.45);\n    \n     \\node [below] at (8.5,-.35){\\textsf{\\textbf{Quantity of Loanable Funds}}};\n     \\node [above] at (8.5,4.65){\\textsf{\\textbf{Market for 3-Month (Short-Term)}}};\n     \\node [above] at (8.5,4.25){\\textsf{\\textbf{Risk-Free Debt}}};\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (6.75,1) [out=10, in=-115] to  (9.5,3.5);\n      \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (7,.5) [out=10, in=-115] to  (10,3);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, red] (7.25,3.75) --  (10.5,1.5);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (7,3.25) --  (10.25,1);\n     \n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (6,1.70) --  (9,1.70);\n     \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (6,2.5) --  (8.75,2.5);\n     \\node [left] at (6,1.7){$i_2$};\n     \\node [left] at (6,2.5){$i_1$};\n     \\node [below] at (10.5,1){$D_{2}$};\n     \\node [below right] at (10.5,1.5){$D_1$}; \n      \\node [above] at (10,3){$S_2$};   \n       \\node [above] at (9.5,3.5){$S_1$}; \n      \n      \n       \\draw (12,0) rectangle (17,4);\n       \\draw(13,0)--(13,.25) (16.5,0)--(16.5,.25);\n       \\draw [thick,dashed,red] (12,2) --  (16,2);\n       \\node [right] at (16,2){$YC_1$};\n       \\draw [ultra thick, drkgreen](12.25,2.5)[out=-10,in=150] to (16.5,1);\n       \\node [above] at (16.5,1){$YC_2$};\n       \\node [above,rotate=90] at (11.75,2){\\textsf{\\textbf{Yield}}};\n       \\node [above] at (14.5,4.65){\\textsf{\\textbf{Yield Curve}}};\n       \\node [below] at (13,0) {\\textsf{\\small{3 Months}}};\n        \\node [below] at (16.5,0) {\\textsf{\\small{10 Years}}};\n         \\node [below] at (14.5,-.5){\\textsf{\\textbf{Term to Maturity}}};\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\caption{Impact of a Sudden Expectation of Lower Interest Rates}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\end{center}\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{The Forward Rate} Investors monitor the yield curve to determine the rates that exist for securities with various maturities. If investors were indifferent to maturities, the return of any security should equal the compounded yield of consecutive investments in shorter-term securities. The forward rate is sometimes used as an approximation of the market's consensus int rate forecast. \n\\[\\boxed{1+f_{[t,t+1]}=\\frac{(1+r_{t+1})^{t+1}}{(1+r_t)^t}.}\\]\n\n\\subsection*{Liquidity Premium Theory}\\noindent\nSome investors may prefer to own short-term rather than long-term securities because a shorter maturity represents greater liquidity. In this case, they may be willing to hold long-term securities only if compensated by a premium for the lower degree of liquidity. The preference for the more liquid short-term securities places upward pressure on the slope of a yield curve. The liquidity premium may change over time. As it does, the yield curve will change also.  This is the \\textbf{liquidity premium theory}.\n\\paragraph{Estimation of the Forward Rate Based on a Liquidity Premium} When expectations theory is combined with liquidity theory, the yield on a security will not necessarily be equal to the yield from consecutive investments in shorter-term securities over the same investment horizon. \n\nFor example, the yield on a two-year security is now determined as\n\n\\[(1+r_2)^2=(1+r_1)(1+f_{[1,2]})+LP_2\\]\nwhere $LP_2$ denotes the liquidity premium on a two-year security. The yield generated from the two-year security should exceed the yield from consecutive investments in one-year securities by a premium that compensates the investor for less liquidity. The relationship between the LP and term to maturity can be expressed as follows:\n\\[0<LP_1<LP_2<LP_3<\\cdots<LP_{20}\\]\nIf liquidity influences the yield curve, the forward rate overestimates the market's expectation of the future int rate. A more appropriate formula for the forward rate would account for the liquidity premium.\n\\[f_{[1,2]}=\\frac{(1+r_2)^2}{(1+r_1)}-1-\\frac{LP_2}{(1+r_1)}\\]\n\n\\subsection*{Segmented Markets Theory}\\noindent\nAccording to the \\textbf{segmented markets theory}, investors and borrowers choose securities with maturities that satisfy their forecasted cash needs. Pension funds may prefer long-term securities to coincide with their long-term obligations; whereas commercial banks may prefer more short-term investments.  If investors and borrowers participate only in the maturity market that satisfies their particular needs, then markets are segmented.  That is, investors (or borrowers) will shift from the long-term to short-term market, or vice versa, only if the timing of their cash needs changes. Therefore, \\textit{the choice of long-term versus short-term maturities is determined more by investors' needs than by their expectations of future interest rates.}\n\n\\section*{INTEGRATING THE THEORIES OF TERM STRUCTURE}\\noindent\nIn order to understand how all three theories can simultaneously affect the yield curve, first assume the following conditions:\n\\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-2pt, topsep=-2pt, leftmargin=.5in]\n\\item Investors and borrowers who select security maturities based on anticipated int rate movements currently expect int rates to rise (\\textit{upward sloping}).\n\\item Most borrowers are in need of long-term funds, while most invetors have only short-term funds to invest.\n\\item Investors prefer more liquidity to less.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\begin{figure}[h]\\begin {center}\n\\resizebox{7cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n     \\draw (0,0) rectangle (8,5);\n     \\draw [ultra thick, drkgreen] (.70,1.6)[out=20,in=180] to (6,2.5);\n      \\draw [ultra thick, blue] (.65,1.65)[out=35,in=180] to (6,3.25);\n      \\draw [ultra thick, red] (.6,1.7)[out=45,in=180] to (6,3.75);\n      \\node [right] at (6,2.5) {\\textsf{E}};\n      \\node [right] at (6,3.25) {\\textsf{E+S}};\n       \\node [right] at (6,3.75) {\\textsf{E+S+L}};\n       \\node [above, rotate=90] at (0,2.5){\\textsf{\\textbf{Annualized Yield}}};\n       \\node [below] at (4,0){\\textsf{\\textbf{Term to Maturity}}};\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\\vspace*{-6pt}\n\\caption{Effect of Conditions in Example of Yield Curve}\\vspace*{-12pt}\n\\end{center}\\end{figure}\nIn this example, all conditions placed upward pressure on long-term yields relative to short-term yields. In reality, there will sometimes be offsetting conditions.\n\\subsection*{Use of the Term Structure}\n\\paragraph {Forecasting Interest Rates} At any point in time, the shape of the yield curve can be used to assess the general expectations of investors and borrowers about future int rates. Expectations about future int rates must be interpreted cautiously because of liquidity and specific maturity preferences could influence the yield curve.  Still, the curve's shape should provide a reasonable indication of the market's expectations about future int rates.\n\\paragraph{Forecasting Recessions} Some analysts believe that flat or inverted yield curve indicate a recession in the near future. The rationale is that, given a positive liquidity premium, such yield curves reflect the expectation of lower int rates. This in turn is commonly associated with expectations of reduced demand for loanable funds, which could be attributed to expectations of a weak economy. \n\\paragraph{Making Investment Decisions}\n\\paragraph{Making Decisions about Financing}\n\n%Chapter 4\n\\chapter{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad FUNCTIONS OF THE FED}\\vspace*{-.5in}\n\\noindent The \\textbf{Federal Reserve System}, often referred to as the Federal Reserve or simply \"the Fed,\" is the central bank of the United States. It was created by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. Over the years, its role has evolved and expanded. \n\nToday, the Federal Reserve's responsibilities fall into four general areas:\n  \\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-1pt, topsep=-1pt, leftmargin=.5in]\n    \\item conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions \n      in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices \n    \\item supervising and regulating banking institutions to ensure the safety and soundness \n        of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of \n        consumers \n    \\item maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that \n        may arise in financial markets \n    \\item providing certain financial services to the system -- to the U.S. government, to \n        the public, to financial institutions, and to foreign official institutions, \n        including playing a major role in operating the nation's payments systems \n  \\end{enumerate}\nAs a central bank, the Fed has the responsibility for conducting national monetary policy in an attempt to achieve full employment and price stability (low or zero inflation). With its monetary policy, the Fed can influence the state of the economy in the following ways.\n\\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-2pt, topsep=-2pt, leftmargin=.5in]\n  \\item Since monetary policy affects int. rates, it has a strong influence on the cost of borrowing by households and thus determine what households can afford and how much to spend.\n  \\item Monetary policy also affects the cost of borrowing by businesses and thereby influences how much money businesses are willing to borrow to support or expand their operations.\n  \n\\end{enumerate}\nBecause the Fed's monetary policy affects int. rates, it has a direct effect on the prices of debt securities and an indirect effect on the prices of equity securities.\n  \n\\section*{Some Relevant Issues \\& Definitions}\n\\begin{description}\n\\item {\\textbf{Fractional Reserve Banking System:}}  The U.S. has a fractional reserve banking system, which means that a bank must hold or \\textit{reserve} some portion of the funds that have been deposited in it, in a form approved by the Fed. (As a result, a bank may lend to borrowers only a fraction of what it takes in as deposits.)\n\n\\item {\\textbf{Reserves}} consist of \\hl{deposits at the Fed, plus currency that is physically held by banks (vault cash)}.  Total reserves can be divided into two categories: reserves that the Fed requires banks to hold (required reserves) and any additional reserves the banks choose to hold (excess reserves).\n\n\\item {\\textbf{Reserve Requirement Ratio}} – the proportion of bank deposit accounts that must be held as reserves. The ratio is set by the Federal Reserve.\n\nNote: Who is subject to Reserve Requirements?\nBefore 1980, only Fed member banks; afterward, all depository institutions.\n\n\\item {\\textbf{Monetary Base}} – currency in circulation plus the total reserves in the banking system (this also represents the sum of the Fed’s monetary liabilities)\n\\item {\\textbf{Money Supply}} – the amount of ``money\" available to the economy at a point in time. However, we have multiple definitions of what counts as money:\n  \\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1pt, topsep=-1pt, leftmargin=.25in]\n    \\item \\textbf{M1} = currency + checking deposits (demand deposits)\n    \\item \\textbf{M2} = M1 + savings deposits, MMDAs, overnight repurchase agreements, Eurodollars, non-institutional money market mutual funds, and small time deposits\n    \\item \\textbf{M3}= M2 + institutional money market mutual funds, large time deposits, and \n        repurchase agreements and Eurodollars lasting more than one day\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{description}\n\\noindent\n\\underline{\\textit{Notes}}:\n\\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1pt, topsep=-1pt, leftmargin=.5in, label=$\\circ$]\n\\item M2 is probably the most common money supply measure that is reported and analyzed.\n\\item M3 is thought to be overly volatile and overly broad, and as a result the Fed no longer publishes M3 (some other sources estimate it).\n\\item Sometimes, the monetary base is referred to as M0 (M-zero)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE FED} \\noindent\nInitially each district bank had the ability to affect the money supply. Over the times, the system became more centralized, and money supply decisions were assigned to a group of individuals rather than across 12 district banks. \n\nThe Fed earns most of its income from the int on its holdings of US govt securities. It also earns some income from providing services to financial institutions. Today, the Fed has five major components:\n\\begin{center}\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.5}\n\\rowcolors{2}{Turquoise!50}{gray!10}\n\\resizebox{15.5cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{7cm}p{6cm}}\n\n\\rowcolor{blue!35}\\textbf{\\textsf{Fed Component}}&\\textbf{\\textsf{What It Is}}&\\textbf{\\textsf{What It Does}}\\\\  \nBoard of Governors (Federal Reserve Board) & Seven-member board that is at the head of the Federal Reserve System; Members appointed by the President and serve 14-year terms.

Monetary policy is implemented through actions such as increasing/decreasing interest rates, or changing the amount of money banks must hold as reserves (thus increasing or decreasing the availability of funds in the banking system to be loaned out).\n\\begin{framed}\nMonetary Policy is the management of the money supply and interest rates in an economy.\n\\end{framed}\n\\subsection*{How the Fed Controls and Implements Monetary Policy}\n\\paragraph{FOMC Meetings} The FOMC normally meets eight times per year (approx. every 6 weeks) and \\textit{makes decisions on the target money supply growth level and the target interest rate level}.\n\nAbout two weeks before the FOMC meeting, the \\textbf{\\textit{Beige Book}} (a report on the regional economic conditions in each of the Fed districts) is distributed to the FOMC members.\n\nAt the FOMC meeting, attended by the 7 members of the Board of Governors, the 12 presidents of the Fed District Banks, and various Fed staff members, \\textit{economic conditions are reviewed and discussed in detail}. Particular attention is paid to inflation, unemployment, business activity, gross domestic product (GDP), interest rates, and financial market conditions.\n\nThe FOMC then decides (votes) whether the prevailing money supply and interest rate target levels should be maintained or revised.\n\n\\paragraph{How the Fed Implements Monetary Policy?} The Federal Reserve implements policy using 3 major tools: \n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.5in, itemsep=-1pt, topsep=-1pt]\n\\item \\textbf{Open Market Operations}. The buying and selling of U.S. Treasury \\& fed agency securities in the open market \n\\item \\textbf{Discount Window Lending} (Adjusting the Fed's Loan Rate). Lending to depository institutions directly from their Federal Reserve Bank’s lending facility (the discount window), at rates set by the Reserve Banks and approved by the Board of Governors \n\\item \\textbf{Adjusting Reserve Requirements}. Requirements regarding the amount of funds that depository institutions must hold in reserve against deposits made by their customers. \n\\end{itemize}\n\\textit{\\hl{Of these tools, Open Market Operations is the most important}.} In the past, the Fed has leaned more heavily on Discount Window Lending and/or Adjusting Reserve Requirements, but for the past 20 years or more they have depended almost exclusively on Open Market Operations.\n\\subsection*{Open Market Operations}\\noindent\nIf the Fed decides to undertake a change in monetary policy, its decision goes to the Trading Desk (or Open Market Desk) at the New York Fed District Bank. \\hl{The FMOC objectives will be specified as a target range (rather than one specific target level) for money supply growth and/or the fed funds rate}.  \n\nThe \\textbf{fed funds rate} is the short term (usually overnight) rate charged on loans between depository institutions (\\underline{not} the rate between the Federal Reserve and banks).\n\nThe buying and selling of Treasury securities in the secondary market (referred to as open market operations) is the primary method undertaken to implement the policy changes.\n\n\\paragraph{The Impact of Fed Purchases or Sales of Securities}.\n\nFed Purchase of Treasury Securities $\\rightarrow$ Increase in the Money Supply $\\rightarrow$ Decrease in the Fed Funds Rate\n\nFed Sale of Treasury Securities  $\\rightarrow$\tDecrease in the Money Supply\n\t\t\t\t$\\rightarrow$\tIncrease in the Fed Funds Rate\n\n\n\\paragraph{How do Fed purchases and sales increase and decrease the money supply and fed funds rate?}.\n\n\\noindent\\textit{When the Fed \\textbf{purchases} Treasury securities}, the banks and/or dealers that sell the securities will receive funds from the sale and the banking system will thus experience an increase in funds (expansion of money supply).\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.5in, label=$\\Rightarrow$]\n\\item The availability of more funds to lend (more supply) will put downward pressure on the cost of those funds (decreasing the fed funds rate).\n\\end{itemize}\n\\noindent\\textit{When the Fed \\textbf{sells} Treasury securities}, the banks and/or dealers that buy the securities will pay for them from their existing funds and the banking system will thus experience a decrease in funds (contraction of money supply). \n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.5in, label=$\\Rightarrow$]\n\\item The availability of less funds (less supply) to lend will put upward pressure on the cost of those funds (increasing the fed funds rate).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{Discount Window Lending (Adjusting the Fed’s Loan Rate)}\\noindent\nThe \\textbf{Discount Window} is the mechanism by which banks can borrow reserves from the Federal Reserve. The rate charged for such loans is called the \\textbf{Discount Rate}.\n\nPrior to 2003, the Fed would raise or lower the Discount Rate to encourage/discourage borrowing from the Fed, which served as a monetary policy tool -- increases or decreases in such borrowing increased or decreased the money supply (but it was a rather ineffective tool).\n\nSince 2003, short-term lending by the Fed to depository institutions has been primarily viewed as a \\textit{\\hl{source of liquidity, rather than a monetary policy tool}}. The rates on these loans are now referred to as the \\textbf{primary-credit lending rate} and the \\textbf{secondary-credit lending rate}.\n\\subsection*{Adjusting Reserve Requirements}\\noindent\n\\textbf{Reserve requirements} are set by the Fed.  Changes in the required percentage of reserves would influence credit conditions and money supply. An increased percentage requirement means fewer funds are available for lending and a resultant rise in interest rates would be expected. However, since the early 90s, the reserve requirement (on transaction accounts) has been 10\\%.\n\nA recent change is that, since October 2008 the Federal Reserve Banks do pay interest on required reserves and excess reserves on deposit with the Fed.\n\n\n\n\n\\chapter*{Exam Study I}\\vspace*{-.5in}\n\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=10pt]\n\\item What is the basic purpose of financial markets?\n\nTwo key roles of financial markets is to:\n  \\begin{itemize}[label=$\\circ$, topsep=-1pt, itemsep=-1pt]\n\\item \\emph{Accommodate corporate finance needs} − Fin mrkts as mechanisms whereby corporations (deficit units) can obtain funds from investors (surplus units).\n\\item\\emph{Accommodate investment needs} − Fin mrkt offer many investment opportunities.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item\tWhat do we mean by the terms ``surplus units” and ``deficit units”?\n    \n    \\textbf{Surplus units} are individual, business, or government units that \\emph{have} excess funds that can be invested (The Savers). \\textbf{Deficit units}, on the other hand, are individual, business, or government units that \\emph{need} additional funds (The Spenders).\n\n\\item\tHow is the cost of capital and economic productivity impacted by well-functioning or poorly-functioning financial markets?\n\nFinancial markets facilitate the flow of funds and thereby allows financing and investing by households, firms, and government.

However, regulation usually comes with a cost $-$ the cost of oversight and/or compliance, along with possible restrictions that limit market participation. If the cost of regulation exceeds the benefit, it will have a negative impact on efficiency.\n\n\\item\tWhat is the loanable funds theory?\n\nThe \\textbf{loanable funds theory} suggests that the market interest rate is determined by factors controlling the supply of and demand of loanable funds.\n\n\\item\tWhat is the normal (expected) shape of the demand curve and supply curve for loanable funds (upward, downward, flat, etc.)?  \n\nThe shape of the demand curve is downward, and the shape of the supply curve is upward\n\\item\tFor the various ``sources of demand” for loanable funds, which ones are more inelastic and which ones are more elastic, and why?  \n\nFederal government demand for loanable funds is interest-inelastic since government's expenditure and tax policies are thought to be independent of interest rates. Household and business demand for loanable funds is more interest-elastic.\n\n\\item\tFor the supply curve for loanable funds, why would we expect that it would generally be rather steep (or fairly interest-inelastic)?\n\nSince the Fed can influence the supply of loanable funds at any level of interest rates, the supply for loanable can be thought of as interest-inelastic.\n\n\\item\tIn total, which groups are net suppliers and which groups are net demanders of loanable funds?\n\nHouseholds are a \\textbf{net suppliers}; govts and businesses are \\textbf{net demanders} of loanable funds.\n\n\\item\tIn words, what is the equilibrium interest rate?

With a TIPS bond, the face value or principal amount (what gets paid back to the bondholder at maturity) is increased each year by the rate of inflation that occurred in that year. Thus, the bondholder knows that they will get exactly compensated for inflation over time. As a result, the yield (interest rate paid) only has to reflect the ``real rate of return.”\n\nHow TIPS works?\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[snake=zigzag, line before snake = 5mm, line after snake = 5mm,x=40]\n       \\draw (1,0) --(5,0);  \n        \\draw [->, thick] (1.2,.4) --(2,.4) ;\n         \\draw [->, thick] (4,.4) --(4.85,.4) ;\n          \\draw [->, thick] (1.5,-.4) --(2.2,-.4) ;\n         \\draw [->, thick] (3.8,-.4) --(4.5,-.4) ;\n        \\draw  (.5,0) node[above=8pt,left] {Time:};\n        \\draw  (.5,-.2) node[below=5pt,left] {Par:};\n        \\draw  (.5,-1) node[left] {Coupon:};\n        \\draw  (.5,-1.65) node[left] {\\$Amt:};\n        \n        \\draw (1, 0) node[above=3pt] {0};\n        \\draw (3, 0) node[above=3pt] {If inflation = 4\\%};\n        \\draw (5, 0) node[above=3pt] {1};\n        \\draw (1, 0) node[below=3pt] {\\$1000};\n        \\draw (3, 0) node[below=3pt] {1000$\\times$1.04};\n        \\draw (5, 0) node[below=3pt] {\\$1040};\n         \\draw (7, 0) node[below=3pt] {Par gets inflation adjusted};\n        \\draw (1, 0) node[below=20pt] {2\\%};\n        \\draw (5, 0) node[below=20pt] {2\\%};\n        \\draw (1, 0) node[below=38pt] {\\$20};\n        \\draw (5, 0) node[below=38pt] {\\$20.80};\n        \\draw (7.25, 0) node[below=38pt] {Coupon amt is also adjusted};\n       \\draw[] (1,-0.1) -- (1,0.1);\n       \\draw[] (5,-0.1) -- (5,0.1);\n      \n   \\end{tikzpicture}\\vspace*{-.3cm}\n\\end{center}\nSo, in terms of the Fisher Effect relationship, we could say that a regular Treasury bond pays a rate of interest that is $i$ (the nominal, or quoted, rate of interest) and a TIPS pays a rate of interest that is $i_R$ (the real interest rate). Thus, the difference between the regular Treasury rate and the TIPS rate would reflect $E(INF)$ (the expected inflation rate). Since, in the real world, we can easily observe the yield on TIPS and regular Treasuries of the same maturity (say 10 years), market participants often use this difference as a market-based estimate of expected inflation.\n\n\n\\item\tIdentify and understand several different characteristics of debt securities (e.g.,default risk, liquidity, etc.) and the relationship of each of those characteristics to interest rates.\n\\begin{table}[!h]\\sffamily\\footnotesize\n\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.35}\n\\centering\n\\rowcolors{2}{Turquoise!50}{gray!10}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm}p{7cm}p{4.5cm}}\n\\rowcolor{blue!20}\\textbf{Characteristic} & \\textbf{What Does It Mean?} &\\textbf{Relation to Yield Rate}\\\\\nDefault Risk & Credit risk; risk that loans or securities will default, that is be unable to make interest and/or principal payments. &\nThe higher the default risk, the greater the interest rate or yield.\\\\\nLiquidity&The ability to easily sell the security (or convert to cash) without a loss in value. & The less the liquidity (which implies \\emph{more} liquidity \\emph{risk}), the greater the yield or rate.\\\\\nTax Status &The degree to which interest paid by the security is subject to state or federal income taxes. & Taxable securities will have to offer/have a higher before-tax yield than tax exempt securities.\\\\\nTerm to Maturity & The length of time between now and when the security or loan ends, or matures – all promised interest and principal has been paid.\n\n(Incorporates and/or linked to Interest Rate Risk and Inflation Risk)\n&Relationship varies, but most commonly, the longer the term to maturity the greater the uncertainty and the greater the yield/rate.\\\\\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\\item\tWhat do bond ratings measure?

Longer-term securities will have to provide a yield premium to compensate investors for having less liquidity.\n \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The yield curve will be expected to have an upward slope (because of the proposed general demand for a long-term yield premium by investors).\n    \\item The Liquidity Premium Theory does not really have an explanation for a yield curve having a downward slope (inverted).\n  \\end{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Segmented Markets Theory} (or Market Segmentation Theory) says that investors and borrowers choose securities with maturities that match their forecasted cash flow needs. The relative supply and demand for securities within different maturity segments will establish the yield for different terms to maturity.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The yield curve can take on any shape since the relative supply and demand for any maturity segment can be different at different points in time.\n  \\end{itemize}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThere is evidence from research studies that lends some degree of support to each of the theories, but the evidence does not suggest that any one of the theories is totally ``accurate\" alone.\n\\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1pt, topsep=-1pt]\n\\item Interest rate expectations do have a strong influence on the term structure.\n\\item The forward rate derived from the YC does not accurately predict future interest rates consistently.\n\\item\tInvestors do seem to have some degree of liquidity preference, but it cannot fully explain YC shapes.\n\\item There are some variations in the yield vs. term to maturity relationship that are not explained by either expectations and/or a liquidity premium, suggesting other market factors may be at work in some maturity segments\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item\tHow can/do we use a yield spread to capture some of the key information in the yield curve?  Be sure you can equate a yield spread value (+, 0, or -) to the shape and steepness of a yield curve.  \n\nThe \\textbf{yield curve spread} is simply the \\emph{difference between a longer-term Treasury interest rate and a shorter-term Treasury interest rate}.

Did we have a central bank prior to the Federal Reserve?\n\nThe \\textbf {Federal Reserve System}, or simply ``the Fed,\" is the central bank of the United States. It was created by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. Over the years, its role has evolved and expanded. \n\n\\item Know the terms Fractional Reserve Banking System, Reserves, Reserve Requirement Ratio, Monetary Base, and Money Supply.\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\item {\\textbf{Fractional Reserve Banking System:}}  The U.S. has a fractional reserve banking system, which means that a bank must hold or \\textit{reserve} some portion of the funds that have been deposited in it, in a form approved by the Fed. (As a result, a bank may lend to borrowers only a fraction of what it takes in as deposits.)\n\\item {\\textbf{Reserves}} consist of \\hl{deposits at the Fed, plus currency that is physically held by banks (vault cash)}.  Total reserves can be divided into two categories: reserves that the Fed requires banks to hold (required reserves) and any additional reserves the banks choose to hold (excess reserves).\n\\item {\\textbf{Reserve Requirement Ratio}} – the proportion of bank deposit accounts that must be held as reserves. The ratio is set by the Federal Reserve.\n\\item {\\textbf{Monetary Base}} – currency in circulation plus the total reserves in the banking system (this also represents the sum of the Fed’s monetary liabilities)\n\\item {\\textbf{Money Supply}} – the amount of ``money\" available to the economy at a point in time.

Particular attention is paid to inflation, unemployment, business activity, gross domestic product (GDP), interest rates, and financial market conditions.\n\nThe FOMC then \\textbf{\\emph{decides (votes) whether the prevailing money supply and interest rate target levels should be maintained or revised}}.\n\n\n\\item\tWhat are the two underlying economic goals that the Fed is supposed to be focused on in their decisions regarding monetary policy?\n\n\\textbf{Monetary Policy} refers to the actions of a central bank (or other regulatory entity) that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply, which in turn affects interest rates. Monetary policy is implemented through actions such as increasing/decreasing interest rates, or changing the amount of money banks must hold as reserves (thus increasing or decreasing the availability of funds in the banking system to be loaned out).\n\\begin{framed}\nMonetary Policy is the management of the money supply and interest rates in an economy.\n\\end{framed}\n\n\n\\item\tKnow the three major tools that the Fed can use to implement monetary policy.  What is most important nowadays?\n\nThe Federal Reserve implements monetary policy using three major tools: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Open Market Operations}. The buying and selling of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities in the open market \n\\item \\textbf{Discount Window Lending} (Adjusting the Fed’s Loan Rate). Lending to depository institutions directly from their Federal Reserve Bank’s lending facility (the discount window), at rates set by the Reserve Banks and approved by the Board of Governors \n\\item \\textbf{Adjusting Reserve Requirements}. Requirements regarding the amount of funds that depository institutions must hold in reserve against deposits made by their customers. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item\tBe able to clearly describe and identify how and why Open Market Operations are used/implemented.\n\nIf the Fed decides to undertake a change in monetary policy, its decision goes to the Trading Desk (or Open Market Desk) at the New York Fed District Bank. The FMOC objectives will be specified as a \\textbf{\\emph{target range}} (rather than one specific target level) for \\emph{money supply growth} and/or the \\emph{fed funds rate} $-$ the short term (usually overnight) rate charged on loans between depository institutions.  \n\nThe buying and selling of Treasury securities in the secondary market (referred to as open market operations) is the primary method undertaken to implement the policy changes.\n\\item\tWhy do the Fed’s Open Market Operations have a different effect on the money supply than transactions between 2 banks?\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Fed \\textbf{Purchase} of Treasury Securities} & =  \\uparrow \\text{Money Supply} \\implies \\downarrow \\text{Fed Funds Rate}\\\\\n\\text{Fed \\textbf{Sale} of Treasury Securities} & =  \\downarrow \\text{Money Supply} \\implies \\uparrow \\text{Fed Funds Rate}\n\\end{align*}\n\\item\tBe able to clearly describe how the Fed uses monetary policy to “fix a weak economy” and to ``attack high inflation”.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Using Monetary Policy to ``fix\" a weak economy:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Fed purchase of Treasury securities in the secondary market\n\\item Increasing the availability of funds in the economy (increase in the money supply)\n\\item Leading to decreasing interest rates\n\\item\tWhich hopefully leads to more spending (consumption and investment) by households and businesses\n\\item\tWhich spurs economic growth\n\\end{itemize}\n\\item Using Monetary Policy to ``attack\" high inflation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\tFed sale of Treasury securities in the secondary market\n\\item\tDecreasing the availability of funds in the economy (decrease in the money supply)\n\\item\tLeading to an increase in interest rates\n\\item Which hopefully leads to less spending (consumption and investment) by households and businesses\n\\item\tWhich slows down inflation\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\item\tWhat is the conflict that exists between the Fed objectives of full employment and stable prices (w/re to monetary policy)?\n\nIn order to achieve \\emph{economic growth} (full employment), the Fed may need to \\emph{increase} the money supply. But to achieve \\emph{low levels of inflation} (price stability), the Fed may need to \\emph{decrease} the money supply.

Monetary policy refers to decisions that the Fed makes in order to manage the money supply.\n\n\\item\tWhat is inflation targeting?  What are some pros and cons of it?  Do any central banks use this approach?\n\n\\textbf{Inflation targeting} refers to the use of monetary policy to achieve a specific inflation target. From the outset, inflation-targeting frameworks have included four main elements:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item an explicit central bank mandate to pursue price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy and a high degree of operational autonomy;\n\\item explicit quantitative targets for inflation;\n\\item central bank accountability for performance in achieving the inflation objective, mainly\nthrough high-transparency requirements for policy strategy and implementation; and\n\\item  a policy approach based on a forward-looking assessment of inflation pressures, taking into account a wide array of information.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item\tBe familiar with the reading related to inflation targeting (Inflation Targeting Turns 20).\n\n\\item   What is ``passive\" monetary policy?  Pros and Cons?\n\n\\textbf{Passive} monetary policy is basically a \\textit{formula-based approach} to grow the money supply and in sync with economic growth.  Sometimes referred to as ``policy by rule\" implying that the central bank does not introduce any discretion in adjusting monetary policy beyond following the rule.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Pro: It removes efforts to manage something unmanageable, such as the US economy\n\\item Con: Any self-correction mechanism (the invisible hand) may ``take too long\" and that downturns in the economy would perhaps be more severe.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item    What is meant by leading, coincident, and lagging economic indicators?  \n\\begin{description}[leftmargin=.25in]\n\\item {\\textbf{Leading Economic Indicators}}– economic related measures that rise and fall several months before business cycle expansions and contractions\n\\item {\\textbf{Coincident Economic Indicators}} - economic related measures that reach peaks and troughs at essentially the same time as business cycles \n\\item {\\textbf{Lagging Economic Indicators}} - economic related measures that rise and fall several months after business cycle expansions and contractions\n\\end{description}\n\\item  \tWhy would a measure of stock prices (S\\&P 500 stock index) and/or the money supply (M2) be a leading indicator?\n\\item  \tWhat is meant by the concept/process of monetizing the federal debt?  Why might it be done?\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve to increase the money supply to \\emph{offset any increased demand for funds resulting from a larger federal budget deficit} are termed \\textbf{monetizing the debt}. In other words, the Fed is effectively ``financing\" the federal deficit.\n\nThe increased demand for borrowing due to the Federal Government may drive up interest rates and at those higher interest rates businesses are less likely to borrow, thus slowing down economic growth. By ``monetizing the debt\"”\" the Fed absorbs much of the government borrowing by creating more money (via buying up Treasury securities in the secondary market). Increasing the money supply tends to dampen interest rates, or at least keep them from increasing too much, and hopefully allowing businesses to still find it attractive to borrow money and make productive investments that help grow the economy.\n\n\\item    What is Section 13(3) Authority of the Fed?  Has it ever been used?\n\nIn ``unusual and exigent circumstances,\" the Fed may authorize lending to any individual, partnership, or corporation so long as the lending is secured to the satisfaction of the Fed.\n\nThe Fed had never used this until the recent financial crisis. During the crisis, the Fed introduced a number of new ``tools\" for conducting monetary policy. These tools fit into three groups:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{Emergency Liquidity} & \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1. & \\text{Lending directly to financial institutions}\\\\\n2. & \\text{Providing liquidity to key credit markets (e.g., Commercial Paper)}\n\\end{array}\\right.\\\\\n\\text{Quantitative Easing} & \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 3. & \\text{Purchasing longer-term securities to influence the long-term interest rates.}\\end{array}\\right.\\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nThese new programs are referred to as \\textbf{facilities}.

Until present total $\\approx$ \\$1.5 trillion.\n\\end{description}\n\n\\item  \tWhat is the meant by the term ``tapering” with regard to quantitative easing?  What is the status of tapering – just being considered vs has it been started?\n\n\\textbf{Tapering} means that the Fed is gradually decreasing the rate of purchasing bonds, and thus gradually decreasing the rate of creating MS. \n\n\\item  \tBe able to describe how the Fed’s balance sheet (particularly assets) changed during the financial crisis and, in general, how it stands today (relative to pre-crisis levels).  See the Cleveland Fed on-line charts if you need to refresh your memory.\n\n\n\n\\item  \tWhat was the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008?  Is it a form of Section 13(3) authority of the Fed?  Why or why not?\n\\item  \tFrom the reading related to the Review of the Credit Crisis and the Financial Crisis Diagram and discussion that we had, be familiar with some of the items/questions we have noted in class: \n  \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item    How did Fed monetary policy in the early 2000s perhaps contribute to the real estate bubble and the eventual financial crisis? \n    \\item  \tBe able to identify at least 4 factors that probably contributed to the financial crisis (see article and/or diagram) \n    \\item  \tHow were the crisis situations at Bear Stearns and then at Lehman Brothers handled differently?  Why?\n    \\item  What is moral hazard?   What is systemic risk?   Be able to describe some form, or some instance of, possible moral hazard and possible systemic risk during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\n    \\item  What was the TARP or ``Bailout” and how did it work?\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\item Be familiar with the Ben Bernanke \\& Janet Yellen set of articles – not with what person was quoted as saying what thing, but the general overview of Bernanke and Yellen – Do they seem to have similar or different views of quantitative easing and/or other general monetary policy issues? What has Yellen been doing before this recent appointment?  Did Bernanke’s prior background and research interests (pre-Fed) likely influence his approach to what the Fed should do during the financial crisis?\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{document}\n\n\n\n\n",

Chapter 2 Getting Started with Reproducible Research
========================================================

A common mistake that researchers often make is to wait until the end of the research process to begin making their work reproducible. Given today's substantial and constantly updated amount of data available, the consequence of  delaying documenting research progress can be devastating. It can be difficult, and time consuming to sift through all the data files to create an accurate account of how the results are reached. Thus, reproducibility is not an afterthought - it is something that must be built into the project from the beginning.

Reproducibility involves an effective and well-planned research workflow.  The three basic stage of a typical computational empirical research project are:
<ul>
<li>data gathering,</li>
<li>data analysis,</li>
<li>results presentation.</li>
</ul>
Each stage is an equally important part of the complete research. The following are some useful tips to help planning and conducting a reproducible research:
<ol>
<li>Document everything!</li>
<li>Everything is a (text) file.</li>
<li>All files should be human readable.</li>
<li>Explicitly tie all files together.</li>
<li>Have a plan to organize, store and make the files available.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Chapter 5 Storing, Collaborating, Accessing Files, &amp; Versioning</h1>

<p>Today, a collaborative research that involves several researchers from different geographical locations is commonplace. Resolving the issues of storing and accessing is one of the primary concerns. First, data need to be <strong>stored</strong> so that it is protected against computer failure - virus infections, electrical problems, and so on. Storing data locally is generally more prone to loss than on a remote servers in the cloud. Second, the data need to be easily and readily <strong>accessible</strong> by other collaborators and from multiple devices. Finally, we need to store our data in a system that has <strong>version control</strong> that keep track of changes we make to our files and allows us to access previous versions if we want to.</p>

<p>A familiar example of cloud storage is the use of Dropbox. Dropbox is a version-control, cloud storage service that is free-of-charge up to a certain amount of data. It is quick to install and easy to use. To take advantage of this usable tool, potential users need to follow some simple steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, go to www.dropbox.com, register, and create a simple user profile. </li>
<li>Next, download and install the file dropbox.exe. This allows users to create a local file folder, typically named Dropbox, that is connected to their cloud Dropbox account.</li>
<li>Finally, enjoy using Dropbox by either downloading or uploading directly from and to the online account or from the local folder. </li>
</ul>

<p>One major drawback from using Dropbox is that its version-control feature does not keep track of changes we make to our files. For this reason, many professional researchers and programmers embrace the concept of GitHub. Like Dropbox, GitHub provides free cloud storage and enables collaborative activities. Also, its version control can keep track of all the changes and allows users to access previous versions as well. Given the ability to handle more complex tasks, installing and using GitHub requires a little more extensive computer experience, which may be a drawback for novice users.</p>

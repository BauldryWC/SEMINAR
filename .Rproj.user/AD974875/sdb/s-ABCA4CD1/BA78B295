    "contents" : "Chapter 5 Summary- Storing, Collaborating, Accessing Files, & Versioning\n========================================================\n\n- Storing data in a cloud is safer than on your computer or a flash drive because it is protected.\n- Cloud storage allows access to documents from any computer or mobile device and can open up research to more collaborators. \n- Version control manages the different versions of a piece of work and monitors changes.\n \n5.1 Saving Data in Reproducible Formats\n- Using text file formats helps future proof your research.\n- write.table saves data in plain-text formats from R.\n\n5.2 Storing Your Files in the Cloud: Dropbox\n- Dropbox creates a directory on your computer's hard drive in which files are stored, as well in the cloud-based server.\n- Folders on Dropbox can be either Public or Non-Public.\n- An SHA-1 hash is a long string of numbers and letters at the end of a line that serves as a unique ID, assigned by source_data.\n- You cannot save files through a Dropbox URL link.\n- Every time you save a document a new version is created on Dropbox.\n\n5.3 Storing Your Files in the Cloud: GitHub\n- GitHub is an interface and cloud hosting service built on top of the Git version control system. \n- Basically, GitHub has everything that Dropbox has and more, but is more complicated to use as a novice.\n- GitHub stores previous versions indefinitely.\n\n",

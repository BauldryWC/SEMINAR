Chapter 1 Introduction to Reproducible Research
========================================================

**Reproducible research** can be broadly defined as any research that can be easily replicated in the future by any parties who have interests in that research. For research that relies on experiments, this can mean researcher not involved in the original research being able to rerun the experiment and validate that the new results match the original ones. In computational and quantitative empirical sciences, results are replicable if independent researchers can recreate findings by following the procedures originally used to gather the daa and run the computer code.

Reproducibility, as the author believes, ``has been a key part of scientific inquiry." In science, replication opens claims to scrutiny; allowing us to keep what works and discard what doesn't. Also, it allows avoiding effort duplication and encouraging cumulative knowledge development. For an individual researcher, reproducibility does require extra upfront effort; however, in the long-run, reproducible research tools can make the research process more effective and hopefully easier.

Reproducible researh involves two broad sets of tools. The first is a **reproducible research environment** that includes that statistical tools (such as R) that we use to run the analyses. The second set of tools is a **reproducible research publisher**, which prepares documents for presenting results and is easily linked to the reproducible research environment.
